[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/f2ey4fxyc794a277/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/markkerry/pstestmodule/branch/master)

A PowerShell test module incorporating Plaster, platyPS, PSScriptAnalyzer, Github, Pester and Appveyor.
Designed to work on Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core

This is purely a learning experience for me using:

[Plaster](https://github.com/PowerShell/Plaster) for module scaffolding
[platyPS](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS) to write external help in markdown
[PSScriptAnalyzer](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer) a PowerShell best practice code checker for module and scripts
[Github](https://github.com/markkerry/PSTestModule) for version control
[Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester) for unit/integration testing
[Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/markkerry/pstestmodule/branch/master) for continuous integration
